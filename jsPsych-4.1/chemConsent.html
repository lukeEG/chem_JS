			</p>			<h5> 1. Introduction</h5>
                <p>You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Your participation is entirely voluntary. 
Your decision as to whether or not to participate in this study will have no effect on your academic standing or job status. Please ask questions if there is anything about this study that you do not understand.
 </p>
                <h5> 2. What is the purpose of this study?</h5>
                <p> The purpose of this study is to investigate whether learning of scientific concepts can be promoted with certain study strategies.</p>
                <h5> 3. Are there any benefits from participating in this study?</h5>
                <p> You will not personally benefit from being in this research study. We hope to gather information about how different study strategies affect learning of scientific concepts. Your participation helps us to learn more about the factors that influence learning. The data obtained from your participation will be included with data from other participants as part of a scientific study that may be published in a peer-reviewed journal. These results will inform future studies of human cognition and learning. </p>
                <h5> 4. What does this study involve?</h5>
                <p> Your participation in this study will involve 2 separate sessions. Upon completion of the first session, you may be invited to participate in the second session after about 48 hours. The first session should not last more than 60 min, and the second session should not last more than 30 min. You will be compensated for your participation in the first session even if you decide not to participate in the second session. During this experiment, you will be presented with material on a scientific concept. You will study the material and be tested on it. You will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire with questions about your race/ethnicity, age, sex, and language background.</p>
                <h5> 5. What are the risks involved with being enroled in this study?</h5>
                <p> The risks of participating in this research are minimal. There are no known physical, psychological, legal, social or other risks associated with this study. You might find the task slightly boring. All computer files related to this experiment will use a participant code to protect your confidentiality, and will be stored on password-protected computers.</p>
                <h5> 6. Other important items you should know</h5>
                <p> a. Withdrawal from this Study:
You may choose to stop taking part in this study at any time. If you decide to stop taking part, it will have no effect on your academic standing or job status, and you will be compensated for your time at the normal rate.
b. Number of Participants:
We expect about 600 participants to enroll in this study.
c. Funding:
Dartmouth College has provided funding for this research. 
</p>
                <h5> 7. How will your privacy be protected?</h5>
                <p> a. Data Collection: 
The information collected as data in this study includes: your responses to the questionnaire and your responses on the tests of your learning/understanding of the material. The data collected in this study will be maintained indefinitely or as required by federal or state regulations. 
b. Confidentiality:  
Every effort will be made to protect the identities of the participants and the confidentiality of the research data used in this study. Each participant will be assigned a code number, and only these code numbers will be linked to any data collected. The data will also be stored in a secure lab, and will be analyzed on password-protected computers by trained members of the Cognition & Education Lab. Raw data will be available only to Dr. Sean Kang and trained research assistants in the Cognition & Education Lab. The data obtained from your participation will be included with data from other participants; no data will be reported on an individual basis. The information collected for this study will be used only for purposes of research. However, the Dartmouth College Office of the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects may request access to this form to ensure that procedures designed to protect research participants are being followed properly. Despite these safeguards, it is possible for a court or government official to order the release of study data including information about you.
</p>
                <h5> 8. Will you be paid to participate in this study?</h5>
                <p> Yes: You will be compensated for your time spent participating in this study at a rate of up to $5 per hour. If you decide to withdraw from the study before the study is completed, you will still be compensated for time already spent.</p>
                <h5> 9. Whom should you call with questions about this study?</h5>
                <p> Questions about this study may be directed to the researcher in charge of this study: Dr. Sean Kang at (603) 646-1501 or Sean.H.Kang@dartmouth.edu. If you have general questions, concerns, complaints, or suggestions about human research at Dartmouth, you may call the Office of the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College at (603) 646-3053 during normal business hours. </p>
